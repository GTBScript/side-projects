CMake Deprecation Warning:
  Support for "Extra Generators" like

    CodeBlocks

  is deprecated and will be removed from a future version of CMake.  IDEs may
  use the cmake-file-api(7) to view CMake-generated project build trees.


CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory C:/Users/Emkave/Desktop/Git/side-projects/Gravity/cmake-build-debug/_deps/sfml-subbuild/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory c:/Users/Emkave/CLionProjects/Gravity/cmake-build-debug/_deps/sfml-subbuild where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
